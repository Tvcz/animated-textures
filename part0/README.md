# Project Check-in

At least two weeks before the deadline, you need to meet with a TA or the Professor to discuss your final project idea.

## Check list of what to discuss:

Here is what we are going to discuss during the check-in. You can add your own notes after each quest if that is helpful. We expect this to be a concise discussion, of ~5 minutes.

- What is your project going to focus on?
- Have you found resources that can help you and have you properly cited them?
- Have you started your project yet?
  - What challenges do you think you are going to face?
- (If you have started your project)
  - What challenges are you currently facing, and where can we point you to get help?

## Project Strategy

We won't ask you explicitly, but I would hope during this check in you have started, and at the least have a project setup to compile and run some examples. :) 

I've found through personal and professional experiences of my own, and otherwise while watching students, even having an outline and basic skeleton can make things enormously less stressful for all parties involved and result in a better outcome. Once upon a time (me as a student), I use to say "wow, I really can pull things together, get in the zone, do awesome work in the 25th hour" -- the reality is I could have truly done much better work with even a small amount of planning ahead .

## Why a check-in?

It will help keep you on track -- you can do this several weeks before the minimum amount of time if needed. I've also found that this helps combat rushing the final project (which should be a nice portfolio piece you are proud of!), and also combats any urge to panic and plagerise a project (It's happened a handful of times unfortunately)
